# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
# This analysis is done for X Education and to find ways to get more professionals to join their courses. The basic data provided gave us a lot of information about how the potential customers visit the site, the time they spend there, how they reached the site and the conversion rate. 
# Goals of the Case Study
There are quite a few goals for this case study.

 Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
 

# Results Expected

The word document filled with solutions to all the problems.
The overall approach of the analysis in a presentation
Mention the problem statement and the analysis approach briefly 
Explain the results in business terms
Include visualisations and summarise the most important results in the presentation
A brief summary report in 500 words explaining how you proceeded with the assignment and the learnings that you gathered.
